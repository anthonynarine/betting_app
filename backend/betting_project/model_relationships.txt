Relationships:
CustomUser and Group:

A CustomUser can be part of multiple Group instances, and a Group can 
have multiple CustomUser instances. 
This is a ManyToMany relationship.
In your CustomUser model, this relationship is represented by the
"groups" field.

Event and Group:
An Event is associated with a single Group. This means a Group can have multiple
events, but each Event belongs to one and only one Group.
This is a ForeignKey relationship from Event to Group.

Event and CustomUser (participants):
An Event can have multiple participants (CustomUser instances), and
a CustomUser can participate in multiple events.
This is another ManyToMany relationship.
In the proposed design, this relationship could be represented in the
Event model with a field like participants = models.ManyToManyField(CustomUser).


Example Scenario:

Creating Groups and Users:

Let's say you have two Group instances: "Basketball Lovers" in "New York" and
"Football Fans" in "Los Angeles".
And you have three users: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Alice and Bob are part of the "Basketball Lovers" group.
Charlie is part of the "Football Fans" group.


Organizing Events:
The "Basketball Lovers" group decides to organize two events:
A match between "Knicks vs. Nets".
A group meetup to discuss the season.
The "Football Fans" group organizes an event:
A match watch party for "Rams vs. Chargers".


Participation in Events:
Alice decides to participate in both the match and the meetup of "Basketball Lovers".
Bob only participates in the meetup.
Charlie participates in the watch party organized by "Football Fans".

Concluding Remarks:
With the above relationships:

CustomUser (Alice, Bob, Charlie) can be part of multiple Group instances 
and participate in multiple Event instances.
Each Group (Basketball Lovers, Football Fans) can organize multiple
Event instances.
Each Event belongs to a specific Group and can have multiple participants
(CustomUser).

The relationships are flexible and can be used to represent
various scenarios, like users participating in different group activities,
groups organizing various events, and more.
