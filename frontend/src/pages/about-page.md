About Our Betting System
Welcome to [Your App Name], where fairness and clarity in our betting system are at the heart of everything we do. Here’s how our system works:

Understanding the Betting Process:
Placing Your Bets:
Participants can place their bets on their chosen teams before the event starts.
The total pool of bets comprises all the individual bets placed by all participants.
How Winnings are Distributed:
Our system ensures a fair distribution of winnings based on several scenarios:

Single Bettor Scenario:

If you’re the only one who places a bet on an event, don't worry – your bet will be fully refunded, win or lose.
Unanimous Winning Bet:

If every participant selects the winning team, all bets are refunded. It’s a no-risk, no-gain scenario!
Multiple Bettors, One Winner:

In a more exciting scenario with multiple bettors and one winner, the winner gets their proportional share of the total bets.
Example: If you bet $100 in a pool of $1,000 and win, you get back your $100 plus your winning share from the remaining $900.
Multiple Winners:

When several bettors win, each winner gets a share proportional to their individual bet.
Example: If you bet $300 in a total pool of $1,400 and win, you’ll receive a larger share compared to someone who bet $100.
Our Commitment to Fairness:
We believe in a transparent and fair betting environment.
The rules are designed to be straightforward and equitable for all participants.
Our system ensures that your winnings are calculated fairly, encouraging participation and excitement in every event.
We hope this information helps you understand our betting process better. If you have any questions, feel free to contact our support team. Happy betting and good luck!
